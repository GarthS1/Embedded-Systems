# Embedded-Systems
Projects for an embedded systems course done in a group of three people. 

Basic Project Descriptions:

Driver Project 2: When push button one pressed blink light at 1-sec intervals, push-button two pressed blink light at 2-sec intervals, push-button three pressed blink light at 3-sec intervals, more then two pushed light stays on and if nothing is pushed light stays off. 

Driver Project 3: Same as driver project 2 but instead of using polling(calling from main while loop) use interrupts instead. 

Driver Project 4: Similar to driver project 3 but also displays on the screen which buttons are being pressed. 

Driver Project 5: Perform an analog to digital conversion of the analog voltage from the potentiometer from pin 8 and display the value in hex. Also, generate a bar graph where the width corresponds to the digital output value.

Application Project 1: Make a countdown timer with the following features; button one increases the minutes, button two increases the seconds, a short button three press starts the countdown and a long button three press resets the timer to zero. 

Application Project 2: Use the analog to digital conversion to measure the voltage from pin 8 if button one is pressed and the resistance at pin 13 if button two is pressed. 

Midterm Project: Add onto Application Project 2 the ability when pressing button three to measure the pulses at pin 15 from pin 18.
